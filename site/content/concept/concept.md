## Concept ([NL](https://www.sustainerhomes.nl/concept/))
### Design within reach

Sustainer Homes, believes modern techniques, make realising your own sustainable design, simple. Which is ideal – because traditional construction leaves a lot to be desired. If you have plans for your own sustainable dream home – here's some starting points:

**Sustainable, circular construction pioneers**

It's no longer up for discussion: people now understand sustainable construction is win-win. But what does that mean for a Sustainer Home?

- **Natural, renewable source materials**
	- The skeleton of a Sustainer Home uses managed wood, from certified Finnish forests. Doing so, a Sustainer Home will store more CO2 than released during it's lifetime. We do this using hardly any steel, plaster, concrete and cement – which is also great for your health!
- **As few materials as possible**
	- For materials, we know less really is more. Combining supple, constructive wood and ancient Japanese joints – we minimise materials, eradicating waste. Design by evolutionary algorithm, robotic precision manufacturing reduces the resource footprint even further. All this is perfect at reducing costs of building materials, transport, and assembly.
Which has a net-positive affect on the energy consumption of the whole project.
- **Future-proofing our buildings**
	- First of all, we want you to know our buildings surpass the highest standards. Infact, they're years ahead of present requirements.
	- For example, as well as triple glazing, a Sustainer Home is particuarly well insulated. This includes an airtight, high-specification, damp-proof climate system, powered by Solar panels.
	- The result is a comfortable, healthy, energy efficient home, set for the future.
We use only the highest quality materials that demand little, to no maintenance at all. And, as requirements change over time, a Sustainer Home can adapt to your needs.
	- Smart construction means tweaking lighting, or the layout of interior walls more versatile. Making our properties more stable than traditional buildings.
- **Do we take reuse into account?**
	- The Sustainer Homes methodology is inspired by cradle-2-cradle principles, aimed at eliminating waste. This means our raw materials can be recovered into raw materials for another project. And, if a certain location is no longer suitable, a Sustainer Home can be moved somewhere else.
	- After two years, Rabo Groenhuis, needed this versatility moving from Hilversum to Jaarbeursplein.
	- During construction, we don't glue any joints, so we can reuse modules or relocate entirely!
	- **The information age**
		- Each element uses a QR code that corresponds to a location in a 3D model, describing it's unique form. Each identifies where they fit, assembly, disassembly details and how long modifications take.
		- None of this is yet appreciated in policy, standards or valuation – but we are prepared, today.

**Energy and CO2 neutral**
Thanks to these principles, Sustainer Homes are energy and CO2 neutral. We do not use unhealthy, scarce raw materials and we aim to make buildings that can be fully reused. This way, high quality living standards can be made available to everyone, everywhere. It's also why Sustainer Homes are 200 tons of CO2 less than regular home ownership.

Definitely a step in the right direction.
