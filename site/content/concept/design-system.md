### A design system ([NL](https://www.sustainerhomes.nl/concept/#een-slim-systeem-voor-jouw-ontwerp-op-maat))
Precise housing requirements rarely occur twice. Similarly, industrial techniques improve quality, reduce waste, cost and the need to recycle. To solve the contradiction between bespoke production and large scale manufacture... we developed our own design system, inspired by Lego.

This way, we can create unlimited numbers of designs with a limited number of components.

<!-- ### The discovery phase-->

Everything starts with your idea and how the environment surrounds your plot. We make an extensive inventory of your requirements, family composition and functional needs.

We consider the plot's best light, location of your neighbors, and how to capture the most scenic view.

After rounds of sketches, we create your unique design. In the background, there is a process assisted by our own tooling. This qualifies the feasibility of the design... if it complies with regulations and is on budget.

- **Sleek architecture**
	- Our designs are full of elegant details. Thanks to precision manufacturing, Sustainer Homes don't conceal anything. Pure, clean lines create a functional, modern appearance making Sustainer Homes distinctive.
- **Custom design, built under controlled conditions**
	- Each building consists of precise, individual modules. Robot-milled laminated parts made to on-site requirements are assembled on a production line. Here, quality assurance is guaranteed lowering any thermal inefficiencies.
- **Low maintenance & Long lifespan**
	- High-quality design details and material use, translate into two things... a low maintenance building with an exceptionally long service life. These principles have informed the entire process, where we have considered every screw.
- **Fast turn-around**
	- Traditional construction means following ordered steps one-by-one according to a labor schedule. Whereas, off-site prefabrication means things happen in parallel. A Sustainer Home can be assembled whilst simultaneously laying the foundation. This cuts months off construction time so you can get on with packing the removal van!
