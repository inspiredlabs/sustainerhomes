## Our obsession with details ([NL](https://www.sustainerhomes.nl/concept/#obsessie-met-details))

Once we started designing, every detail became important. We hope you share our obsession with details... reflected in a scientific approach to sustainability, process optimisation and architectural detail. Examples:

- **Floor to ceiling glass**
	- Standard in Sustainer Homes are the beautiful full length windows. These create an extraordinary, seamless connection from your interior to the outside world. Complete walls of glass can be elegantly incorporated into the floor to bring in even more light. And, triple glazing has brilliant insulation and acoustic properties.
- **Customise your ceiling**
	- Our ceilings use sleek plating, made to measure by robot, within a tenth of a millimeter. With precision manufacturing, the carpenter's proverb has never been truer: Equal is unequalled!
- **Walls without concealing discrepancies**
	- Sustainer Home walls fit snugly, without the need for a skirting board, kick plate or cornice. This is only standard in high-end architecture. And Sustainer Homes.
	- This saves you money on materials too.
- **Full height doors as standard**
	- Sustainer Homes have ceiling-high interior doors. These use a timber frame system integrated into the walls, which are self-developed. The result is traditional or invisible hinges create a high-quality, tight coherent aesthetic.
- **Our own algorithm for your stairs**
	- The sleek stair designs come from our architects using internally  developed tools. This software enables us to offer traditional solid wood or bamboo that works.

<!-- High quality design and production -->
Proven by a hundred years of Bauhaus philosophy... industrial design and manufacturing leads to higher quality products.
The highest quality finishes are possible, because of new design and production techniques. Parametric design, computer-controlled milling and robot manufacture make construction more accurate than ever.
