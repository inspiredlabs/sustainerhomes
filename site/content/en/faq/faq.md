## [Veelgestelde vragen, NL](https://www.sustainerhomes.nl/veelgestelde-vragen/)

Do you want to know more on finding a plot? What's possible regarding financing? Do you other questions? Here you can review popular questions about location, finance, and design. Question not listed? Get in touch: info@sustainerhomes.nl or call us [+31 030 207 2160](tel:+310302072160).

### Plots
- Where can I find a building plot?
  - Building plots can be found through a broker, your municipality and online. There's also different purpose plots on offer for agriculture or gardening. In certain cases, you can request a change of land use. Keep in mind that zoning restrictions mean changes are an intensive, time-consuming process. Sustainer Homes have extensive info to help you find the right location for your new build.
- Can I building in another country... such as Belgium, France or Germany?
  - Sustainer Homes are based on Dutch laws and regulations and can only be built in the Netherlands.
  - Currently, we are investigating building across other European countries. We expect to eventually make progress elsewhere soon.

### Finance

- What is the cost of a sustainer home?
  - The cost of a Sustainer Home depend on interacting factors.
You must take into account costs for your plot, foundations, transportation and design. You can find information about our price structure in the brochure.
- What financing options are there for a Sustainer Home?
  - A self-build mortgage covers both the plot and the building finance. We have listed finance options in the brochure. And don't forget to ask your mortgage advisor about subsidies for sustainable builds.

### Energy options
- What's best: energy neutral, zero-on-the-meter or Self-sufficient..?
    - As standard, Sustainer Homes generate their own energy from solar panels. An energy-neutral home generates enough power for your heating, hot water and lighting. A zero-on-the-meter implementation goes further... generating enough power to run your domestic devices. Here, you can read about the finance benefits available for sustainable building!
- Can I build off-grid in the Netherlands?
  - Off-grid utility rules differ for each local municipality. Every custom designed Sustainer Home can use off-grid mixed with regular connections. Although, off-grid isn't necessarily more sustainable! You can read more about it in our article about self-sufficient building.

### Design & Construction

- How much time does it take to realise a self-build?
  - The duration varies per project. Generally it can be around one and a half years from the first sketch to completion. You can read more about the phases in our brochure.
- What makes a Sustainer Home more sustainable than traditional, regular build?
  - A Sustainer Home is both more sustainable than a regular home in use and during construction. They're made of sustainable, recycled raw materials and wood from certified, managed forests.
  - A Sustainer Home is energy neutral... the solar panels and heat pump ensure a pleasant temperature all year round. And, we avoid materials such as steel and concrete. These harm the environment with high CO2 emissions and water consumption.
- What kind of wood does Sustainer Homes use?
  - We use PEFC certified wood from a Finnish company called Metsä.  They produce a product called LVL: laminated veneer lumber, which is extremely strong. It uses biodegradable glue to bond thin wooden layers together over each another.
  - With a Sustainer Home, you can choose the finish of your building facade. If you want an authentic wooden finish, we recommend thermally preserved firing. This heats the wood dissipating sugars and starches within. Preventing insect decay or fungi, the method preserves wood's strength and integrity.
- What is the lifespan of a Sustainer Home?
  - Sustainer Homes meet all requirements for the Building Decree for permanent homes. Timber frame homes are very low maintenance so the lifespan is equal to a conventional home.
- Can you move a Sustainer Home?
  - No. The format of a Sustainer Home is not designed to be a mobile home. In principle, you can dismantle and moved the modules (as proven by one of our clients). Foundations, however, are liad in a specific location and can not move elsewhere. Mortgages are not available for buildings may relocate. From experience, we do not recommend a Sustainer Home if your aim is to relocate.
- Can I extend my existing home with a Sustainer Home?
  - Sustainer Homes work with fixed-size modules. This makes connecting to an existing building limited. A Sustainer Home is an  optimal, integrated, insulated, whole building solution. That means they particularly suited as a complete building.
- Can Sustainer Home modules be added later?
  - It is possible to rebuild a Sustainer Home. Modules intergrated into the ventilation system and the foundation and can't be switched. It is always cheaper to build a house in one go than extend later.
- Do Sustainer Homes design Tiny Homes?
  - Our modular system can effectively design any sized building.
Due to fixed costs, such as installation, small buildings are relatively more expensive.
  - Sustainer Homes can work off-grid. This means a minimum surface area for solar collection on the roof and battery space is required. There are also legal requirements for the minimum area of ​​the space, if this is not a holiday home. And, Sustainer Homes aren't mobile homes.
