### Building can be much better <!--Sustainer Homes-->

Established to make architecture more flexible, accessible and  sustainable... Sustainer Homes believes _building can be much better_.

The idea came into being as Solar panels were being installed on a roof in 2014 with the aim of making sustainable builds accessible to everyone.

Sustainer Homes was concocted at Startupbootcamp, by the four founders... [Gert van Vugt](https://www.sustainerhomes.nl/over/) (CEO), [Jacintha Baas](https://www.sustainerhomes.nl/over/) (COO), [Sol van Kempen](https://www.sustainerhomes.nl/over/) (Architect) and [Wolf Bierens](https://www.sustainerhomes.nl/over/) (CTO).

After working out the idea, their first investor helped produced a prototype.

Now, we make it possible to build everything from business premises to holiday homes. And, we want to make sustainable construction accessible to the broader market.
