## Building can be much better <!--Sustainer Homes-->

Established to make architecture more flexible, accessible and  sustainable... Sustainer Homes believes building can be much better.

The idea came into being on a roof in 2014. Solar panels were being installed and sustainable building was becoming accessible to everyone. 

Sustainer Homes was concocted at Startupbootcamp, by the four founders... Gert van Vugt (CEO), Jacintha Baas (COO), Sol van Kempen (Architect) and Wolf Bierens (CTO).

After working out the idea, their first investor helped produced a prototype.

Now, we make it possible to build everything from business premises to holiday homes. And, we want to make sustainable construction accessible to the broader market.
