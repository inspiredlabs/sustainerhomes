### Four steps to Sustainer Home ownership

There are four steps to Sustainer Home ownership: Orientation, Design, Contracts and Production.

- **Orientation** <!-- https://www.sustainerhomes.nl/onderwerpen/kavel-voor-zelfbouw/ -->
	- The right location depends on hundreds of factors, reflected by budget and implementation details. Don't have a plot yet? Our information page can help you on your way. Still looking how to get financing? We have more tips for you here too!
  - Do you have plot option and want to know if it is possible to build a Sustainer Home there? We do no-obligation zoning for you to help determine what your options are. Interested? Call for an appointment!
- **Design**
  - How closely will Sustainer Homes match your idea?
Your housing requirements will result in a custom design. One of our architects will help you understand and configure the possibilities.
  - Everything is structured around your requirements, family, building regulations and budget. The resulting design will absolutely fit your unique situation.
  - After you're happy the design is completely satisfactory
we'll progress to the definitive design. Sustainer Homes provide all the documentation for your final municipal permit application.
- **Contracts**
  - Is your building permit valid? Then we can start. As one of our construction partners, you sign a contracting agreement. Here, the price and delivery agreements are formally bedded down. As standard, we work with a _Home&nbsp;Guarantee_ to be certain your home will always be completed.
- **Production**
  - All wooden components are milled and delivered in kit-form to the contractor. Mainly assembled indoors, each property comes complete with frames, interior walls and bathrooms. Your foundation should be prepared in location.
  - Trucks transport the modules on-site to be located on the foundation â€“ this only takes a day or two. After this, there is a few weeks finishing the building completely. We need to install solar panels, finish the facade and seal the installation, for example.
  - You walk through the house with the delivery contractor. This is a good time to choose an inspection date for The Home Owners Association. Then, the contractor has a few more week to completing any final points.
